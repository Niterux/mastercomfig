## Fixing performance bug on EGS

On EGS, many people report performance problems and long load times in the launcher, while many others do not. After experimenting with some settings (to boost download speeds below), I may have found the cause for this. It seems like the HTTP thread sucks away time from other threads, which basically makes your load times inverse to your HTTP speeds possibly, as the UI cannot load due to long pause times from HTTP.

1. Go to `%localappdata%/EpicGamesLauncher/Saved/Config/Windows`
2. Open `Engine.ini`.
3. Paste in the following:

```ini
[HTTP]
; Limits the HTTP thread to only take time away for the duration it is able to do work
; Ref: https://twitter.com/phyronnaz/status/1489317573485383680
HttpThreadActiveFrameTimeInSeconds=0.00001
```

## Boosting Download Times

For many on stable and fast Internet connections, although EGS has decent speeds compared to other launchers, it does not reach the peaks we would like. For this guide, I will provide some settings to max out your download/install speeds on EGS, for gigabit fiber ethernet connections. Other connections may suffer with these settings, but the documentation provided may help you to better understand the available settings and tweak on your own. Feel free to contribute settings which work for your Internet!

!!! note
    This also includes the above "Fixing performance bug on EGS" tweak, as it also improves download speeds.

1. Open Epic Games Store.
2. Click your Profile Icon and click Settings.
3. Enable Throttle Downloads.
4. Enter your max Internet speed in kilobytes per second. This will allow EGS to stably target your download speed, which seems to reduce cases of huge amounts of variance and jitter in download speeds. For example, assuming a fiber connection, setting this to `1000000`, instead of the download speed jumping up and down between 99MB/s and 80MB/s, you can remain at a stable 100MB/s with this setting.
5. Close Epic Games Store.
6. Go to `%localappdata%/EpicGamesLauncher/Saved/Config/Windows`
7. Open `Engine.ini`.
8. Paste in the following:

```ini

For more information, Epic Games Launcher uses the same ChunkDownloader and HTTP systems as in Unreal Engine, so its [source code](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/ue5-main/Engine/Source/Runtime/Online/BuildPatchServices) and [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Patching/ChunkDownloader/Quickstart/) is available for everyone.
